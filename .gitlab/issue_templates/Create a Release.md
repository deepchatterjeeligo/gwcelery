## Playground deployment

4.  [ ] Sentry does not show any new [unresolved issues on playground](https://sentry.io/organizations/ligo-caltech/issues/?environment=playground&groupStatsPeriod=14d&project=1425216&query=is%3Aunresolved&statsPeriod=14d) that indicate new bugs or regressions.
5.  [ ] The playground deployment has run for at least 10 minutes.

7.  [ ] The [Flask dashboard](https://emfollow-playground.ligo.caltech.edu/gwcelery) is reachable.
8.  [ ] The playground deployment is connected to LVAlert.
9.  [ ] The playground deployment is connected to GCN (receiving only).

## Mock events

10. [ ] The playground deployment has [produced an MDC superevent](https://gracedb-playground.ligo.org/latest/?query=MDC&query_type=S).
11. [ ] The MDC superevent has the following annotations.
    - [ ] `bayestar.multiorder.fits`
    - [ ] `bayestar.fits.gz`
    - [ ] `bayestar.png`
    - [ ] `bayestar.volume.png`
    - [ ] `bayestar.html`
    - [ ] `p_astro.json`
    - [ ] `p_astro.png`
    - [ ] `em_bright.json`
    - ~~[ ] `LALInference.posterior_samples.hdf5`~~ (LALInference known to be broken; see #273)
    - ~~[ ] `LALInference.multiorder.fits`~~ (LALInference known to be broken; see #273)
    - ~~[ ] `LALInference.fits.gz`~~ (LALInference known to be broken; see #273)
    - ~~[ ] `LALInference.png`~~ (LALInference known to be broken; see #273)
    - ~~[ ] `LALInference.volume.png`~~ (LALInference known to be broken; see #273)
    - ~~[ ] `LALInference.html`~~ (LALInference known to be broken; see #273)
12. [ ] The MDC superevent has the following labels.
    - [ ] `EMBRIGHT_READY`
    - [ ] `GCN_PRELIM_SENT`
    - [ ] `PASTRO_READY`
    - [ ] `PE_READY`
    - [ ] `SKYMAP_READY`
13. [ ] The MDC superevent has two automatic preliminary VOEvent if `GCN_PRELIM_SENT` is applied.
14. [ ] Issuing a manual preliminary alert from the [Flask dashboard](https://emfollow-playground.ligo.caltech.edu/gwcelery) sends another preliminary alert.
    - [ ] The alert **is sent** successfully if `ADVOK` or an `ADVNO` label is **not applied** this time.
    - [ ] Alternatively, a preliminary alert is **blocked** due to presence of `ADVOK` or `ADVNO`.
15. [ ] The MDC superevent has either an `ADVOK` or an `ADVNO` label.
16. [ ] Issuing an `ADVOK` signoff through GraceDB results in an initial VOEvent.
17. [ ] Issuing an `ADVNO` signoff through GraceDB results in a retraction VOEvent.
18. [ ] Requesting an update alert through the [Flask dashboard](https://emfollow-playground.ligo.caltech.edu/gwcelery) results in an update VOEvent.
